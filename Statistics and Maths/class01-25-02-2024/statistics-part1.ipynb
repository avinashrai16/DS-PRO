    "# Analytics refers to the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics. There are various types of analytics, each serving specific purposes and utilizing different techniques. Here are some of the main types of analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Descriptive Analytics**:\n",
    "#    - Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing historical data to understand what has happened in the past.\n",
    "#    - It involves techniques such as data aggregation, data visualization, and summary statistics.\n",
    "#    - Descriptive analytics provides insights into trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Diagnostic Analytics**:\n",
    "#    - Diagnostic analytics involves analyzing data to determine why certain events occurred.\n",
    "#    - It aims to identify the root causes of problems or opportunities by examining historical data and relationships.\n",
    "#    - Techniques include correlation analysis, root cause analysis, and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Predictive Analytics**:\n",
    "#    - Predictive analytics aims to forecast future outcomes based on historical data and statistical algorithms.\n",
    "#    - It uses techniques such as regression analysis, time series forecasting, and machine learning models.\n",
    "#    - Predictive analytics helps organizations anticipate trends, behavior, and events to make proactive decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Prescriptive Analytics**:\n",
    "#    - Prescriptive analytics focuses on providing recommendations or decisions to optimize outcomes.\n",
    "#    - It combines insights from descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics to suggest the best course of action.\n",
    "#    - Techniques include optimization algorithms, simulation models, and decision analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Text Analytics**:\n",
    "#    - Text analytics involves analyzing unstructured textual data to extract insights and patterns.\n",
    "#    - It includes techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and text mining.\n",
    "#    - Text analytics is used to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, and textual documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Big Data Analytics**:\n",
    "#    - Big data analytics involves analyzing large and complex datasets to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and trends.\n",
    "#    - It requires specialized tools and technologies to process, store, and analyze massive volumes of data.\n",
    "#    - Techniques include distributed computing frameworks, parallel processing, and advanced analytics algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Real-time Analytics**:\n",
    "#    - Real-time analytics involves analyzing data as it is generated or collected to make immediate decisions.\n",
    "#    - It requires fast data processing capabilities and low-latency systems to analyze data in real-time.\n",
    "#    - Real-time analytics is used in applications such as financial trading, fraud detection, and IoT (Internet of Things) monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Each type of analytics plays a crucial role in helping organizations derive insights, \n",
    "# make informed decisions, and gain a competitive advantage in today's data-driven world. \n",
    "# Depending on the business objectives and data available, organizations may leverage one or more types of analytics to extract value \n",

    "\n",
    "# Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the basic features of a dataset. \n",
    "# There are various types of descriptive statistics that provide insights into different aspects of the data. \n",
    "# Here are some common types of descriptive statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Measures of Central Tendency**:\n",
    "#    - These statistics describe the center or average of a dataset.\n",
    "#    - Common measures include:\n",
    "#      - Mean: The average value of the dataset.\n",
    "#      - Median: The middle value of the dataset when arranged in ascending order.\n",
    "#      - Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Measures of Dispersion**:\n",
    "#    - These statistics quantify the spread or variability of the data points.\n",
    "#    - Common measures include:\n",
    "#      - Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "#      - Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "#      - Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, providing a measure of the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Measures of Shape**:\n",
    "#    - These statistics describe the shape of the distribution of data.\n",
    "#    - Common measures include:\n",
    "#      - Skewness: Measures the asymmetry of the distribution.\n",
    "#      - Kurtosis: Measures the peakedness or flatness of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.1 **Measures of Symmetry**:\n",
    "#  Measures of symmetry specifically focus on whether the distribution is symmetric or not.\n",
    "#  They assess if the distribution can be divided into equal halves by a central point (e.g., the mean or median).\n",
    "#  If a distribution is symmetric, it means that the shape of the distribution is the same on both sides of the central point.\n",
    "#  Measures of symmetry are often used in conjunction with measures of shape to provide a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of data.\n",
    "# - Common measures include: Assess whether the distribution is symmetric or skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Frequency Distribution**:\n",
    "#    - Frequency distribution summarizes the number of times each value occurs in the dataset.\n",
    "#    - It can be presented as a table or a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Percentiles**:\n",
    "#    - Percentiles divide the dataset into hundredths and represent the value below which a given percentage of observations fall.\n",
    "#    - The median, for example, represents the 50th percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Summary Statistics**:\n",
    "#    - Summary statistics provide a concise summary of key characteristics of the dataset.\n",
    "#    - They may include minimum, maximum, quartiles, and percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Correlation Coefficients**:\n",
    "#    - Correlation coefficients measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "#    - Common measures include Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman rank correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. **Cross tabs and Contingency Tables**:\n",
    "#    - These statistics summarize the relationship between two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# These descriptive statistics help analysts understand the central tendency, variability, distribution, and relationships within a dataset. \n",
    "# They are essential for data exploration, hypothesis generation, and decision-making in various fields such as business, research, and social sciences.\n"
