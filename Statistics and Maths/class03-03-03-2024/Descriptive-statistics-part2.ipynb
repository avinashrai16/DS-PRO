    "\n",
    "1. **Skewness**:\n",
    "   - Skewness measures the degree of asymmetry in a distribution.\n",

    "   - Positive kurtosis (leptokurtic) indicates a distribution with heavier tails and a sharper peak than the normal distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Pearson's Median Skewness Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - This coefficient measures the asymmetry of a distribution based on the difference between the mean and median.\n",
    "   - It's calculated as 3*((Mean - Median)/Standard Deviation).\n",
    "   - A value close to zero suggests symmetry; positive values indicate right skew, and negative values indicate left skew.\n",

    "   - L-moments are statistical quantities used to characterize the shape of probability distributions.\n",
