    "In statistics, the level of significance and confidence are two related concepts often used in hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Level of Significance (α)**:\n",
    "   - The level of significance, denoted by α, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
    "   - It represents the risk of making a Type I error, which occurs when you reject a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "   - Commonly used levels of significance include 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%), and 0.10 (10%). These values are somewhat arbitrary and are chosen based on the context of the problem and the acceptable balance between Type I and Type II errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <b>*p-value*</b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "      The p-value is a probability value used to determine the statistical significance of an observed effect in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "      It quantifies the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "      If the p-value is less than or equal to the chosen level of significance (α), typically 0.05, then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "      A common interpretation is: \"The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "      The p-value is directly related to the level of significance (α):\n",
    "\n",
    "      If the p-value is less than α, you reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      If the p-value is greater than α, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Confidence Level**:\n",
    "   - The confidence level is the complement of the level of significance. If the level of significance is α, then the confidence level is (1 - α).\n",
    "   - It represents the probability that the confidence interval will contain the true population parameter, assuming the sampling procedure is repeated a large number of times.\n",
    "   - For example, if you construct a 95% confidence interval for a population parameter, it means that if you were to construct many confidence intervals using the same procedure, approximately 95% of them would contain the true population parameter.\n",
    "   - Common confidence levels include 90%, 95%, and 99%, but other values can be used as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are often used together in hypothesis testing and estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In hypothesis testing, you choose a level of significance (e.g., α = 0.05), and if the p-value calculated from the sample data is less than α, you reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the α, the less likely you are to reject the null hypothesis when it is true, leading to a more stringent test.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In constructing confidence intervals, you choose a confidence level (e.g., 95%), and the resulting interval is an estimate for the population parameter. The higher the confidence level, the wider the interval, as you are more certain (with higher probability) that the true parameter lies within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both concepts are essential in statistical inference, helping researchers draw conclusions from data while considering the inherent uncertainty involved in statistical analysis."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "To conduct hypothesis testing for this scenario, we will follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate Hypotheses**:\n",
    "   - Null Hypothesis (H0): The average time working mothers spend talking to their children is 11 minutes per day.\n",
    "     (H0: mu <= 11)\n",
    "   - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The average time working mothers spend talking to their children is greater than 11 minutes per day.\n",
    "     (Ha: mu > 11)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose a Significance Level (α)**:\n",
    "   - Given α = 0.05 (5%). and this is a one tail test as the alternate hypothesis is greater than mean\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collect Data**:\n",
    "   - Sample size (n) = 100 working mothers.\n",
    "   - Sample mean bar{x}= 11.5 minutes per day.\n",
    "   - Population standard deviation sigma = 2.3 minutes (based on prior research).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Test Statistic**:\n",
    "   - Since the population standard deviation sigma is known and the sample size is large (n > 30), we can use the z-test.\n",
    "   - The test statistic for testing the population mean is calculated using:\n",
    "   \n",

    "     Z = 11.5 - 11/(2.3/sqrt{100})\n",
    "       = approx 2.17\n",

    "5. **Determine Critical Region**:\n",
    "   - Since the alternative hypothesis is one-tailed (greater than), we are interested in the right tail of the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "   - At a significance level of 0.05, the critical value for a one-tailed test is Zα = 1.645 (obtained from standard normal distribution table for z table).\n",
