    "A factory has a machine that dispenses 80 ml of fluid into a bottle. an employee believes that the average amount of fluid isn't 80 ml. using 40 samples, he measures the average amount dispensed by the machine to be 78 ml. machine standard deviation is 2.5 ml. state the null and alternative hypothesis. at a 95% confidence level, is there enough evidence to support the idea that the machine is not working properly?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Answer:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis (H0):** The machine dispenses an average of 80 ml of fluid (μ = 80 ml).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The machine does not dispense an average of 80 ml of fluid (μ ≠ 80 ml).\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if there is enough evidence to support the idea that the machine is not working properly, you can perform a two-tailed hypothesis test at a 95% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance Level (α):** 0.05 (5% level of significance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the sample data, you can perform a Z-test (because you know the population standard deviation) to compare the sample mean (78 ml) to the hypothesized population mean (80 ml).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "​<img src=\"https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/zscoreformulaone.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(\\bar{X}\\) = Sample mean (78 ml)\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(\\mu\\) = Population mean under the null hypothesis (80 ml)\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(\\sigma\\) = Population standard deviation (2.5 ml)\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(n\\) = Sample size (40)\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Z = \\frac{78 - 80}{\\frac{2.5}{\\sqrt{40}}}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Z \\approx \\frac{-2}{\\frac{2.5}{\\sqrt{40}}} \\approx -5.05\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, compare the absolute value of the Z-score to the critical Z-value at a 95% confidence level. You are performing a two-tailed test, so you need to find the critical Z-values for the upper and lower tails of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a 95% confidence level (α = 0.05), you would use a Z-table or calculator to find the critical Z-values. For a two-tailed test with α = 0.05, the critical Z-values are approximately ±1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculated Z-score (-5.05) is much smaller in magnitude than the critical Z-value (-1.96), you would reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** At a 95% confidence level, there is enough evidence to support the idea that the machine is not working properly, as the sample mean of 78 ml is significantly different from the hypothesized population mean of 80 ml.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if further testing shows that the machine was actually working properly (meaning the null hypothesis is true), the employee made a **Type 1 error**. This is because they incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis when it was, in fact, true. A Type 1 error occurs when you conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when there isn't one."
