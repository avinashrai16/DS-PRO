    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling of the normal distribution refers to adjusting its parameters, namely the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ), to fit a particular dataset or to transform it into a standard form. There are two main types of scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardization**: This involves transforming the data so that it follows a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It's achieved by subtracting the mean from each data point and then dividing by the standard deviation. This process is also known as z-score normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Mathematically, for a random variable X following a normal distribution with mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ), the standardization formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Z = (X - μ)\\σ\n",
    "\n",
    "   where Z is the standard score or z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalization**: This involves scaling the data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. It's useful when the original data spans different scales and needs to be brought to a common scale for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The normalization formula scales each data point X to a value X' within a new range:\n",
    "\n",
    "   X' = (X - min(X))/(max(X) - min(X))\n",
    "\n",
    "   where min(X) and max(X) are the minimum and maximum values in the original dataset, respectively.\n",
