    "   \\[ \\text{Geometric Mean} = \\sqrt[n]{x_1 \\times x_2 \\times \\ldots \\times x_n} \\]\n",

    "It is calculated by dividing the number of observations by the reciprocal of each number, then taking the reciprocal of the result.\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Harmonic Mean} = \\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{x_1} + \\frac{1}{x_2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{x_n}} \\]\n",
