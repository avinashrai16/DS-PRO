        "# Code Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Abstraction promotes the creation of reusable components and modules. Abstracting common functionality into generic units allows these units to be reused across different parts of the system or in different projects.\n",

        "\n",
        "# Isolation of Changes: Abstracting details helps in isolating changes. If there's a need to modify or extend a specific functionality, developers can focus on the abstraction layer without affecting the rest of the system.\n",

        "# Team Collaboration:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Abstraction provides a shared vocabulary and a common understanding of the system's structure. This facilitates effective communication among team members, even when they are working on different components of the system.\n",
