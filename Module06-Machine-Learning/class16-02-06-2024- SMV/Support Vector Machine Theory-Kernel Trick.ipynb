    "\n",
    "Choosing a kernel totally depends on what kind of dataset are you working on. If it is linearly separable then you must opt. for linear kernel function since it is very easy to use and the complexity is much lower compared to other kernel functions. I’d recommend you start with a hypothesis that your data is linearly separable and choose a linear kernel function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then work your way up towards the more complex kernel functions. Usually, we use SVM with RBF and linear kernel function because other kernels like polynomial kernel are rarely used due to poor efficiency. But what if linear and RBF both give approximately similar results? Which kernel do we choose now?"

A Parametric Model is a concept used to describe a model in which all its data is represented within its parameters.  In short, the only information needed to predict the future from the current value is the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of the RBF kernel grows as the training data size increases. In addition to the fact that it is more expensive to prepare RBF kernel, we also have to keep the kernel matrix around, and the projection into this “infinite” higher dimensional space where the data becomes linearly separable is more expensive as well during prediction. If the dataset is not linear then using linear kernel doesn’t make sense we’ll get a very low accuracy if we do so."
